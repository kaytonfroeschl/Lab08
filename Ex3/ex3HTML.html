            Miley Stewart is a fourteen-year-old middle school student who appears to 
            live a normal life as a teenager. Unbeknown to the general public, Miley 
            holds a secret identity as international pop singer Hannah Montana; an alias 
            she fabricated in order to live a private life away from the public 
            spotlight. The teenager uses a blonde wig when appearing as Hannah to conceal
            her true identity. Miley's best friend Lilly Truscott uncovers the truth about 
            Miley's hidden alter ego after her unsuccessful attempts to hide the celebrity
            identity. Throughout the first season, Lilly adopts the alias of Lola in order
            to assist in protecting Miley's secret. Miley's father, Robby Ray Stewart, was
            a famous country music singer before retiring from the industry to focus on
            raising his two children, Miley and her older brother Jackson, after the death 
            of his wife. At the commencement of the series, the family have moved from 
            Tennessee to Malibu, California to allow Miley the opportunities associated
            with her musical career, with Robby Ray working as the singer's manager.
